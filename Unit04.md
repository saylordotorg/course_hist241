**Unit 4: Japan** <span id="4"></span> 
*Countries on China’s borders, including Japan, were deeply influenced
by their powerful neighbor.  Not only did China attempt to expand its
power into these regions, but these areas also attempted to emulate many
aspects of Chinese society. *  
  
 *In Japan, the influence of Chinese civilization was most evident
during the Imperial Age.  Between the seventh and ninth centuries,
bureaucratic reforms borrowed heavily from those initiated in China.  In
addition, intellectuals and aristocrats embraced Chinese literary,
artistic, and religious traditions.  Many Japanese, heavily influenced
by Chinese Buddhism, integrated it into their indigenous Shinto belief
system.  But as imperial Japan weakened and the provincial aristocracy
gained power, Chinese customs were increasingly disregarded.  The rise
of Heian aristocracy led to a “flowering” of art and literature, along
with a departure from the Chinese writing system. This unit will analyze
the early development of Japanese social, political and cultural
systems.*
