**Unit 7: East Asia in a New Global** <span id="7"></span> 

*When Vasco da Gama, the Portuguese explorer, discovered trading routes
to Asia in the fifteenth century, it revolutionized the European world. 
However, the Chinese and Japanese were only marginally affected by
European contact.  While Europeans were keen to procure Asian
goods—paper, silk, cotton textiles, glass, gunpowder—the peoples of
China, Japan, and Korea had little interest in Europeans or their trade
goods.*  
  
 *As strong maritime powers, the Portuguese, Dutch, and English exerted
control over much of the trading network that stretched from the Middle
East to East Asia.  However, while Europeans were able to control the
seas, they made few gains on land.  The state and military prowess of
China and Japan presented formidable challenges to Europeans.  Even in
southeast Asia, where weaker states were more vulnerable to European
influence, European tribute systems and missionary efforts had only a
limited impact upon native peoples.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will consider how Europeans came to dominate the
Asian trading network between 1500 and 1700.  However, you will also see
that East Asian peoples were only marginally affected by this
phenomenon—Europeans had few ideas, goods, or religious beliefs that
East Asian peoples wanted to embrace.*
