**Unit 3: China's Golden Age: The Sui, Tang, and Song Dynasties** <span
id="3"></span> 
*After the fall of the Han dynasty in 589 C.E., China descended into
political and cultural turmoil.  The bureaucracy collapsed and a
“foreign” religion—Buddhism— replaced Confucianism as the primary force
in cultural life.  The scholar-gentry lost power to landed families. 
Decline was evident in technology, in the economy, and in the cities. 
But beginning in the latter sixth century, three successive dynasties
restored the Chinese bureaucracy and economy.  As you will see in this
unit, the Sui, Tang and Song reinvigorated the Chinese political system,
engineered massive public works projects, distributed land in an
equitable manner and revived the Confucian order.  These influential
dynasties ushered in China’s “golden age,” an era of technological,
artistic, and literary flourishing that ultimately formed connections
with the cultures and societies of Europe.*

    The Sui
    Dynasty](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/china-history-podcast-015/id489369498?i=108577771)” (iTunes)  
        
     Instructions: Please scroll down the webpage to the “CHP-024 The
    Sui Dynasty” lecture, and select the “View in iTunes” link to launch
    the lecture.  Please listen to the entire 21-minute lecture from
    Lazlo Montgomery, an amateur historian who hosts the “China History
    Podcast” series.  This lecture will address the brief, but
    significant reign of the Sui Dynasty and will touch on religious
    (namely Buddhist), cultural, technological, and political aspects of
    Sui society.  The rise of the Sui Dynasty brought about an expansion
    in China’s canal system, culminating with one of, if not the most
    impressive accomplishment of the era, the building of the Grand
    Canal.  This transportation innovation greatly improved the flow of
    goods and people and remained a vital artery to Chinese commerce
    until the 19<sup>th</sup> century.  This topic is also covered by
    the first paragraph of the reading assigned below subunit 3.1.  
        
     Listening to this lecture and taking notes should take you
    approximately 30 minutes to complete.

**3.1.2 Sui Excess and Collapse** <span id="3.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the second paragraph of the reading
assigned below subunit 3.1.  The early successes of the Sui soon became
overshadowed by the military failures and strife of conscripted
peasants.  Think about the following questions as you read.  In what
ways did the Sui emperors lose the “Mandate of Heaven?”  How can we view
the Grand Canal as both a success for the Tang and a cause for its
eventual downfall? *

**3.2 Emergence of the Tang Dynasty** <span id="3.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
3.1.  Focus specifically on the section entitled, “The Sui & Tang
Dynasties,” (from the third paragraph to the end of the section) and
“The Rise of the Scholar-Gentry Class.”  The implementation of the
equal-field system and the expansion of the imperial civil service exams
brought about a cultural an economic boom during the Tang Dynasty.  With
its system of roads and an international capital at Chang’an, the Tang
built on the triumphs of the Sui and ushered in a golden era of Chinese
culture.*

    bureaucracy of the Tang influenced its cultural artifacts.  From
    scroll paintings to ceramics to calligraphy, this lecture will
    discuss aspects of the economy, military, and political
    administration of the Tang Dynasty.  The imperial civil service
    examination system created a large class of trustworthy and highly
    educated bureaucrats capable of coordinating the affairs of the
    state.  Viewing this lecture and taking notes should take you
    approximately 45 minutes to complete.

**3.3.1 Partial Restoration** <span id="3.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
3.3.  After a period of about 60 years without one clear, dynastic rule,
the Song came to power and built upon the foundations laid by the Han,
Sui, and Tang.  A relatively weak dynasty militarily, the Song Dynasty
witnessed an even greater expansion of the civil service examination
system that marked a pronounced shift towards governance based on merit
rather than familial connections. *

    (and Tang) ideas and expanded the series of civil service exams in
    order to train a new class of bureaucrats as Confucian scholars
    capable of handling the growing governmental demands of the state.
     This subunit builds upon the discussion of the examination system
    put in place by the Tang Dynasty as covered in subunit 3.2.  The
    reading assigned beneath subunit 3.3, specifically the section
    entitled “Rise of the Scholar-Gentry Class,” also covers this topic.

     Instructions: Please read all of the sections of this webpage to
    learn more about the rival groups who challenged the borders of the
    Song Dynasty and eventually forced its split and demise.  By placing
    the military under the leadership of civil servants rather than
    combat veterans, the Song Dynasty was militarily weak.  Invasions by
    the Khitan, Jurchen, and eventually the Mongols split the kingdom in
    two: Northern Song (960-1127) and Southern Song (1127-1279).  This
    webpage also contains links to further explore the Liao Dynasty and
    the rule of the Khitan.  You will read about the Mongols later in
