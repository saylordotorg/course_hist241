**Unit 6: The Yuan Dynasty** <span id="6"></span> 
 *The Mongols—nomads of central Asia—dominated world history during the
thirteenth century.  The Mongols invaded many postclassical empires and
built an extensive cultural and commercial network.  Led by Chinggis
Khan and his successors, the Mongols brought China, Persia, Tibet, Asia
Minor, and southern Russia under their control.  Though the Mongols are
often portrayed as barbarians and destructive warriors, most of the
peoples they conquered lived in relative peace, enjoyed religious
tolerance, and had a unified law code.  The Mongol empire also opened
trade routes and communication between different regions in Asia.*  
 *             
 In the mid-1200s, Kubilai Khan, the grandson of Chinggis Khan, invaded
China and conquered the Song dynasty.  Known as the House of Yuan,
Kubilai Khan’s regime attempted to preserve a distinction between Mongol
and Chinese culture.  Chinese were forbidden from learning the Mongol
writing system, intermarriage was prohibited between Mongols and
Chinese, and Chinese religious customs and civil service examinations
were largely ignored.  However, Kubilai Khan styled a Chinese-influenced
court in Tatu (Beijing).*  
  
 *In this unit, you will consider how the Mongols tolerated many aspects
of Chinese culture while still preserving their own authority.  You will
also study how China—essentially an occupied territory—was affected by
foreign domination.*

     Instructions: Please read the following chapters written by the
    Venetian merchant Marco Polo, who traveled and lived in China during
    the Yuan dynasty.  Keep in mind that Polo refers to the Mongols as
    the “Tartars.”  Though his stories are often exaggerated (and to
    some degree have questionable authenticity), they do offer the
    viewpoint of an outsider.  His works would inspire many others to
    follow in his footsteps and travel to the East (and eventually to
    the West) in order to seek out the people, places, and goods
    described in his writings.  This reading and note-taking should take
    you approximately 1 hour to complete.
