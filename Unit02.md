**Unit 2: Consolidation in China: The Qin and the Han** <span
id="2"></span> 
*The power of the Zhou dynasty began to falter in the third century
B.C.E.  Rather than consolidating their power into a central authority,
the Zhou had used regional alliances to maintain their influence.  But
when these alliances weakened, so did the Zhou.  The breakdown of the
Zhou Empire permitted both the establishment of many small kingdoms
ruled by former vassals and invasions by nomadic peoples who lived on
the Chinese border.  However, this period of internal warfare known as
the Warring States Period stimulated intellectual ferment and drove
Chinese philosophers, such as Lao-Tzu and Confucius, to question the
spiritual and ethical meaning of the political turmoil.  The
establishment of the brief Qin Empire in 221 B.C.E. seemed to promise a
return to political order.  Emperor Shi Huangdi not only used brutal
techniques and legalist doctrine to consolidate his power, but he also
built the beginnings of the Great Wall of China, standardized a system
of weights and measures, conducted a census of his people, and expanded
his empire.  Qin tyranny, however, produced resistance, especially among
the conscripted peasants and farmers whose labors built the empire and
the dynasty collapsed in 207 B.C.E.  The Han dynasty (which replaced the
Qin dynasty) ruled for nearly four centuries (with a brief interruption)
by achieving political unity through the creation of a large civil
bureaucracy that set a precedent for future dynastic rule in China.
 After the collapse of the Han Dynasty, China splintered into multiple
kingdoms for several centuries.  This period of the Three Kindgoms,
though fragmented politically, would ultimately be the cultural
inspiration for future Chinese scholars and authors.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine how political and social disorder of the
Zhou dynasty later resulted in the centralization of Han dynastic power
and the emergence of a distinct Chinese identity.*

    from Confucius’ *Analects,* and read through all the selections on
    *Jen, Junzi, Li, Yüeh*, Learning and Teaching, Government, and
    Rectifying the Names*. * This document describes the teachings and
    philosophy of Confucius, the Chinese social thinker who lived during
    the Warring States Period.  Written around 500 BCE, his *Analects*,
    focused on the basic Confucian tenets of propriety (li),
    righteousness/benevolence (ren), and loyalty and filial piety
    (xiao), as well as it had an enormous impact on Chinese philosophy
    and moral values.  As you read, think about the time in which
    Confucius wrote and the political and social instability of the era.

    (HTML)**  
        
     Instructions: Please read all of the selections from Xunzi (c.
    298-238 B.C.E.), who had a career as government administrator unlike
    Confucius and Mencius.  Believing that humans were inherently
    greedy, he called for the government to harshly discipline society
    and rigidly emphasized the Confucian principle of *li* or
    “propriety.”  Similar to other thinkers of the period, his followers
    collected his writings and beliefs after his death into the works
    presented here, meaning that Xunzi himself may not have written
    these passages.    
        
     *The reading assigned beneath subunit 2.1, specifically the section
    entitled “Mencius,”* also covers the heirs of Confucius.  Mencius
    and Xunzi offered contrasting ideas about the motivations and
    essential nature of individuals while operating within the Confucian
    framework.  The lecture from Dr. Ronald Suleski in Subunit 2.1.1
    also discusses the heirs of Confucius*.*  You may want to review
    these readings and lectures in conjunction with the reading from
    Xunzi in order to gain a broader comparative perspective on the work
    of Confucian scholars.  
        
     You should dedicate approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes to reading
    the main text for this subunit, taking notes, and re-reading the

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access the text,
    and carefully read all of the selections from the *Dao De Jing,* one
    of the foundational texts of Daoism.  If necessary, it may help to
    re-read the text to better understand the material.  This text was
    supposedly written by Lao-tzu—meaning “Old Master”—the keeper of the
    Imperial library during the Zhou dynasty.  Regardless of whether or
    not Lao-tzu was an actual person, his writings form the basis of
    Daoist philosophy.  The Tao-Te Ching, “the classic of the way of
    virtue,” is comprised of 81 short poems detailing the Tao, or “the
    way.”  According the Lao-tzu, the Tao is nameless, goes beyond
    distinctions, and even transcends language.  
        
     Think about its philosophy in connection with the readings
    presented in Subunit 2.1.2, in particular with *The Analects*.
     Compare how Daoism and Confucian thought developed in the midst of
    political and social turmoil and how Daoism both reacted and
    situated itself in opposition to Confucian principles.    
      
     You should dedicate approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes to studying
    the text and comparing the text to Confucian thought.

    click on “Early Feudal Era,” and finally click on “Han Dynasty (206
    BC - 220 AD).  Read this section on the Han Dynasty in its entirety.
     The Han Dynasty, started by Liu Bang, brought about resurgence in
    Confucian principles in the wake of the harsh Legalist rule of the
    Qin.  The Han built on some of the fundamental Chinese social and
    cultural concepts developed by previous dynasties, especially the
    Zhou.  With the growth of foreign trade during this dynasty, the
    Chinese shaped their own theoretical worldview based on Confucian
    principles.  The Chinese viewed foreign tribes and peoples as
    uncivilized barbarians.  In contrast, Chinese culture was seen as
    the aspiration for all peoples.  Initially, the Chinese would bribe
    more powerful tribes, but over time, as dynasties became more
    powerful, the emperor would use military means and a tribute system
    to subordinate foreign tribes.  Please note that this resource
    covers the topics outlined in Subunits 2.3.1-2.3.3.  This reading

    of Zhang Qian, an envoy of emperor Han Wudi who embarked on a
    13-year journey from the capital of Chang’an to the western
    borderlands of the Xiongnu and Yuezhi.  His trek represents the
    beginnings of the Silk Road as many merchants would follow in his
    footsteps to the frontier of Han territory, ultimately helping to
    create new networks of commerce and transportation in Eurasia.  His
    missions to the “barbarian” peoples on the borders of the Han
    Dynasty reflect the larger focus on the expanding role of foreign
    relations in China.  By sending Zhang to make contact with these
    peoples, the emperor could incorporate them into the Chinese world
    order.  Listening to this lecture and taking notes should take you

     Instructions: Click on the link above to access the Ohio State
    University website.  Then, in the table of contents on the left side
    of the webpage, click on the link entitled “Chinese History,” then
    click on “Early Feudal Era,” and finally click on “Period of
    Disunion and Alien Empires (220-581 AD).”  Read this entire section
    on the late Han Dynasty to examine how internal and external forces
    worked to bring an end to Han rule in China and led to a power
    vacuum in the region.  In the wake of the collapse of the Middle
    Kingdom, smaller areas of political power arose, most notably the
    Three Kingdoms (Wu, Wei, and Shu).  This topic is also covered by
    the reading assigned below subunit 2.3.  Focus specifically on the
    last (or ninth) paragraph of the section.  This reading should take
    you approximately 30 minutes to complete.

    shown in the images here and those you examined in subunit 1.2.5?  
        
     2. What purpose did funerary art serve and what information about
    Han society can we learn from it?  
        
     3. Why are the tomb models so useful in teaching us about Han
    architecture?
