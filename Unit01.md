**Unit 1: Yellow River Civilizations** <span id="1"></span> 
*The first Chinese civilizations emerged along the Yellow River—the
second longest river in China—by the second millennium B.C.E.  Despite
its nickname of “China’s Sorrow,” agricultural societies, drawn by the
river’s fertile soil, developed sophisticated irrigation techniques. 
The Yangshao culture emerged around 2500 B.C.E. and was dependent upon
hunting, fishing, and some agriculture.  But the Longshan/Xia culture,
which developed in 2000 B.C.E., became a more sedentary agricultural
community of large, walled villages.  These societies formed the basis
for the emergence of the Shang in 1500 B.C.E., a feudal society that
became the basis of Chinese civilization—they expanded irrigation
systems, monopolized the use of bronze, and developed a system of
writing.  It was not long, however, before the power of the Shang
declined, and the Zhou (1029-258 B.C.E.), a Turkic people once ruled by
the Shang, rose to power.  The Zhou seized new territory in the Yangtze
River valley and established authority by forging alliances with
regional nobles.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will study how the earliest civilizations bordering
the Yellow River gave way to the Shang, a complex society ruled by
all-powerful kings.  From the Shang period, we will explore the
artifacts known as oracle bones, the earliest evidence of writing in
China. We will examine the overthrow of the Shang by the Zhou, an event
that marked the beginning of dynastic-style rule in China that would
last until the twentieth century. By studying the Zhou, we will examine
the concept of the “Mandate of Heaven,” the importance of controlling
metallurgy, and the writing of works that come to be known as the Zhou
Dynasty Classics. *

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
-   Differentiate between the earliest (and possibly mythical) Chinese
    dynasties and the rise of the powerful Shang Dynasty.
-   Compare how the Shang and Zhou controlled the monopoly of metallurgy
    and evaluate its effects on the political rule of the dynasties.
-   Explain how the fall of the Zhou and the political and social
    uncertainty of the Warring States Period helped give rise to the
    Confucian, Daoist, and Legalist philosophical schools of thought.

    the Han emperor.  This work—Qian’s greatest—was the first systematic
    Chinese historical text and had a profound impact on later Chinese
    historians and poets.  This excerpt contains two biographical
    sketches that serve as both stories of prominent people and as
    lessons on the culture in which they lived.  Attempt to answer the

     Instructions: Please click on the link on the left-hand side titled
    “The Zhou Dynasty,” and read the section to understand how the Zhou
    rose to power and contributed a cultural legacy of texts that
    remained an important aspect of Chinese society into the modern
    era.  Through the establishment of the concept of the Mandate of
    Heaven, the Zhou justified their overthrow of the Shang and
    established a pattern for future dynasties to follow.  The downfall
    of the Zhou led to a period of intermittent fighting in China known
    as the Warring States Period. During this moment of political and
    social instability, intellectuals debated human nature ultimately
    giving rise to profound and dynamic schools of thought.  Make sure

     Instructions: Written during the Zhou period and compiled sometime
    after 600 B.C.E., this is the earliest recorded collection of
    Chinese poetry and the most important of the Zhou dynasty texts. 
    Scholars believe that many of the poems were originally songs. 
    These poems (311 in all) describe ordinary people living during the
    Zhou period, the social and political issues of the day, the Zhou
    court, and the venerated founders of the Zhou state.  Most of the
    poems are short and imagistic—many were often read as allegories.
     Read the background context from the first link to understand the
    impact of the *Shih Ching* on Chinese poetry.  Then, click on the
    second link to read the poem “King Wen is on High.”  Think about how
    this poem relates to the concepts of the veneration of ancestors and
    the Mandate of Heaven. You should spend approximately 1 hour reading
    both texts and studying the poem.
