**Unit 8: Splendid Isolation: Ming China and Japan** <span
id="8"></span> 
*Squeezed between two “foreign” dynasties—the Yuan and the Qing—the Ming
dynasty attempted to place Chinese governance back in Chinese hands. 
Oppressed by the rule of the Mongols, the Ming rose to power when Zhu
Yuanzhang, a military commander of peasant origins, led a revolt against
the Mongols.  He declared himself emperor Hongwu in 1368 and sought to
expel all Mongols and their influences.  After establishing himself at
the capital in Nanjing, Hongwu worked to remedy what he saw as the
defects of the Mongol system.  He styled himself as an absolutist ruler
and consolidated his authority over the nobility.  He also reintroduced
the civil service examination system and assumed control of much of the
administration of his empire.  However, although commercial exchange
between Ming China and European states increased exponentially during
this time, Hongwu and his successors believed that isolationism, rather
than exploration and expansion, would best preserve China.*  
  
 *And in Japan, feudalism persisted between the 1300s and 1700s.  During
this period, powerful regional families called daimyo and Japanese
warlords known as shogun dominated the state.  While conflict between
the daimyos ushered in the era known as the “Warring States Period” in
the latter fifteenth century, Japan became united politically and
militarily by1600 under the leadership of Tokugawa.  Like China, Japan
adopted a policy of isolationism despite persistent European ploys for
commercial goods and Christian conversion.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will study how both Ming China and feudal Japan
remained largely isolated from the European world, concentrating instead
in internal development and domestic conflicts.*
