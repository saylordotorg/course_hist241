This course will introduce you to the history of East Asia from the
early Yellow River civilizations to the Qing Dynasty in the late
eighteenth century.  You will learn about the major political, economic,
and social changes that took place in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam
during this period.  The course will be structured chronologically. 
Each unit will include representative primary-source documents that
illustrate important overarching political, economic, and social themes,
such as the development of a coherent Chinese identity, Chinese imperial
aspirations in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan, the expansion of Western
influence and trade networks, the Mongol invasions, and the role of
Confucianism and Buddhism in East Asian culture.  By the end of the
course, you will understand how East Asia transformed from fragmented
and warring societies into consolidated imperial states that sought to
separate themselves from Western religion and commerce.  The course will
present a variety of resources that will discuss the social, political,
cultural, technological, and materials aspects of East Asian society.

look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 7 hours.  Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete Subunits 1.1.1 and

and 1.2.1 (a total of 2.75 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.
