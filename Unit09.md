**Unit 9: The Last Dynasty: Qing China** <span id="9"></span> 
*The Qing Dynasty was founded when the Manchu—a Tungusic people from
what is now northeast China—overthrew the Ming dynasty in 1644.  The
Qing incorporated many elements of the former Ming state but also
attempted institute a system of more direct rule through local
officials.  The Qing retained the civil service examination system and
preserved the role of the scholar-gentry.  Nevertheless, despite the
Qing’s efforts to continue many Ming traditions and customs, tensions
between the Manchu rulers and the native Han Chinese continued to
exist.  As the ruling minority, the Qing exercised their control over
the Chinese majority by imposing a Queue Order—shaving the head except
for a single long braid—and through literary censorship.  The punishment
for defying the Qing government—through literature or by growing one’s
hair—was usually death.  But by the eighteenth century, Qing control was
showing signs of weakness.  The examination system was plagued by
corruption, with many wealthy families buying political posts or
inheriting them.  Money for internal improvements and other projects
often ended up in the pockets of local bureaucrats.  And several floods
and famines only added to the political unrest and social strife that
was brewing in the Qing state.  Then, in 1796, the White Lotus Rebellion
broke out between impoverished and overtaxed settlers and Manchu
rulers.  Although the Manchu eventually quelled the rebellion in 1804,
the conflict killed 16 million people and shattered the image of an
invincible Qing state.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will study how the Qing attempted to exert control
over the native Han Chinese population.  However, you will also examine
how tensions between the native Chinese and the Manchu rulers began to
surface in the late eighteenth century.*
