**Unit 5: Korea and Vietnam** <span id="5"></span> 
*Similarly to Japan, the earliest developing societies in Korea and
Vietnam also felt the direct influence of their Chinese neighbors.*  
  
 *Korea was more profoundly affected by Chinese civilization than any
other region.  Although Korea developed its own distinct cultural and
political identity, its earliest kingdom, the Choson, was conquered by
the Han dynasty in 109 B.C.E.  After the fall of the Han, Korea adopted
many aspects of Chinese culture—including Buddhist and Chinese
writing—through the process of Sinification.  The growth of the three
kingdoms of Koguryo, Paekche, and Shilla during the first 1000 years of
the Common Era eventually led to two unified dynasties: the Shilla and
the Koryo.  These dynasties established a growing culture and
increasingly complex political structure on the peninsula that
assimilated and rejected aspects of the neighboring societies in Japan
and China.*  
  
 *The fertile, rice-growing region of southeast Asia—Vietnam—attracted
Chinese interest.  The Viet people, however, maintained a separate
society while also voluntarily embracing some aspects of Chinese
civilization.  After the Qin dynasty raided Vietnam around 220 B.C.E.,
commerce increased between the Viets and the Chinese.  However, the Viet
people continued to maintain a distinct ethnicity and language from the
Chinese.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will examine the complex relationship between
Chinese culture and the early Vietnamese and Korean societies.*
